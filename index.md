# About Me

I recently recieved my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering (Communications Systems subfield) from Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran. 

I wish to pursue my educations either in Communications Engineering or Computer Science and am looking for relevant positions in Germany.

# Research Interests

I am interested in computer vision, deep learning and more specifically, I love exploring possible applications of machine learning in communications systems field.

# Research Experience

In summer 2022, I joined _Signal Processing lab_ at _Technichal University of Munich_ as a research intern under the supervision of Prof. Wolfgang Utschick and Julia Sistermans (PhD student). I explored region of interest detection methods (more specifically, RCNNs) to detect white blood cells in digital holographic images of blood.

During summer and fall 2021, I worked in _Machine Learning and Optimization Labratory_ at EPFL as a research intern under the supervision of Prof. Martin Jaggi and Dr. Hartley. My work was implementing unsupervised and self-supervised algorithms for learning useful representations from lung audio sounds to cluster these sounds based on the breathing cycle and pathologies and compare the results with the doctors’ annotations.

Moreover, as my bachelor's project at Sharif University of Technology, I implemented the method proposed in the paper _“Deep-Learning Based End-to-End Communication Systems using GANs as Unknown Channel Models”_. During this project, I became familiar both with GANs' architecture and implementation of a communication system model with PyTorch.
